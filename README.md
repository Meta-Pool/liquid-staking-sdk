# Meta Pool liquid-staking-sdk

Liquid Staking SDK for Meta Pool in the NEAR Blockchain

[MetaPool.app](metapool.app) is a liquid staking protocol built on NEAR. People stake their NEAR tokens with MetaPool and receive a liquid "stNEAR" token representing their staked NEAR. stNEAR is a yield accruing token, and its price versus NEAR increases every epoch (every 15hs, approx. 10% APY). Users can use their stNEAR in DeFi to get extra yield, and they also can unstake and recover their original NEAR any time (the protocol is permissionless and non-custodial)

## Installation

$ npm install @metapool/liquid-staking-sdk
